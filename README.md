### React

- useState(): Used for local reactive state that affects rendering (UI state, forms, toggles, flags, local data).
- useEffect(): Used for side effects after render: API calls, subscriptions, DOM interactions, event listeners, timers, syncing external systems.
- useContext(): Used for sharing state across component trees without prop drilling (auth, theme, session, config, permissions).
- useRef(): Creates a persistent mutable reference that does not cause re-render when changed.
- useMemo(): Memoizes computed values to avoid expensive recalculations and preserve referential equality.
- useCallback(): Memoizes function references to prevent unnecessary re-renders in child components.
